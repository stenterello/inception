# Inception

The Inception project focuses on building Docker containers that communicate with each other. Specifically, this project includes a mandatory part that involves the implementation of three Docker containers: nginx, mariadb, and WordPress. These containers are activated using Docker Compose. In addition to the mandatory part, I have completed the bonus part, which includes the implementation of Adminer, Redis, an FTP service, and the highly challenging installation of the C-based frontend software, cgit.

Completing the Inception project has been an exciting and rewarding experience. It required me to configure and integrate multiple Docker containers, ensuring seamless communication and functionality. Implementing the mandatory containers, including nginx, mariadb, and WordPress, allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of containerization and orchestration.

The bonus part of the project provided an opportunity to explore additional technologies and services. Implementing Adminer, Redis, and the FTP service added valuable functionalities to the container ecosystem. Moreover, the installation of cgit, a frontend software written in C, was a significant challenge. However, the satisfaction of successfully setting up cgit was immense, as I have a great admiration for this powerful software.
